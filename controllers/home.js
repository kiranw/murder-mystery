I feel like I really should follow my own advice and see a therapist.... but anyway, I guess I'll just keep recording all my <strong class='secret'>secret</strong> thoughts and feelings until I do.</p><p>I mean, this past week, I heard from my dad for the first time in a long time! There's a part of me that feels like I've been too harsh on him, but I still feel so angry. After what he did to mom... I mean, I can't believe he was cheating on her with that Rebecca woman ten years ago! And who knows for how long! Had I not found that letter she was writing him, he might even still be doing that now! </p><p>So I'm angry. But I also feel guilty.... I know he's getting old now, and he is my dad after all. Maybe it wasn't right of me to walk out the way I did, packing my bags for boarding school, and telling him I didn't want to see him ever again. Maybe I was just an impulsive fifteen year old... but maybe that was right? </p><p>I mean, based on his note to me, it does sound like he's changed, and maybe it's because of that! I mean, I didn't even know that he follows my Felicity X activism blog! Honestly, it's a little embarrassing, because sometimes I use it as an outlet of my anger toward him and write things critical about his company. Like the perverse incentive structures that his company employed to get providers to prescribe his drugs. Especially when we don't even fully know what those prescriptions do to patients in the long run. Or the fact that his fellowship for so long never selected a person of color, until Nora... feel like it's coming full circle that Nora is now running for a board position at the company.</p><p>But yeah, it's hard to balance writing very real things about my dad on an anonymous blog, and not being a little bit over the top because of all I feel about him.... but also just how defensive I feel when anyone else among my activist friends tries to say anything about him. Like, family is family after all. Although I guess they don't know that.</p><p>I don't know.... his letter was really thoughtful. I can't believe he said he'd been following my blog, and that it really made him rethink a lot of his life's work. He even said he's changed his will, to give more to charity, and to restructure some of the other things he's doing... and I guess most of all, he talked about how he really had to face his personal truths and apologize to mom, and how they've since worked on their marriage a lot.</p><p>He said he really wants me to be there at his retirement ceremony on Friday.... I don't know. I feel like I should go. Maybe it's time for our family to come back together.</p><p>But damn am I going to hate having to rub shoulders with all those bougie people. Everyone asking all those questions about my <strong class='secret'>background</strong>. Having to duck all those questions about my relationship with my dad. Although I guess a lot of these people probably get it, rich people with kids in boarding schools and all. I've always just talked about how I went to Phillips Exeter, and that kept me away from home, and then how I went to Williams and really focused on women's issues and racial justice, and how I write and help community organize now. All the rich people love to hear that! I never get a follow-up question. Guess it is cool though, that dad might actually be proud of that.</p>";

And not even that - where does the voice of the artist even fall anymore?<span class='blinking-cursor'>|</span></p><br><strong>From:</strong> Avena Chang<br><strong>To:</strong> Diana Obrist<br><strong>Subject:</strong> A request from your friends at Museum of Chinese Art and History<br><br><br><p>Dear Diana,</p><br><p>Hope things have been well since we last met up! I'm constantly reminded of how lucky I am to have met at the Agatha Fellowship. I'm writing to ask for a favor- </p><p>As you know, one of our most prized pieces at the museum is a centuries old precious rare red jade horse, endowed to us by the Erasmus Family. While we are grateful to be able to preserve this historic artifact, it is only a small part of a whole set, one which was intended to be viewed by the general public. It was made to be enjoyed as a complete whole, and from its historical context, know that it served as a community icon of hope and unity during its time. Even in their construction, it is evident that the composition of the horses was intended as their final form, not the sculptures as individual. </p><p>We know that the rest of these rare sculptures are with the Agatha family, and that they are currently privately on display at the Agatha Manor.</p><p>We heard that you would be attending Agatha's gala, to represent our class year of the fellowship. I also have been actively reading your blog posts about advancing accessibility for rare art for the public - not just those who can afford it, who will treat art as an investment instead of an experience. Would you be willing to ask Agatha if he would be willing to donate the rest of the collection back so it can be honored in its intended form?</p><p>We attached a picture of the sculpture we have here if it helps!</p><br><br>Attachment:<br><a href='/img/horsesculpture.jpg'>horsesculpture.jpg</a><br><img src='/img/horsesculpture.jpg' class='attachment'>";

Mallowan, </p><p>We received credible information that an attempt may be made on Christopher Agatha’s life, during his retirement gala tomorrow evening. Your next assignment will be to attend undercover as an invited guest and identify the suspect. </p><p>Peter Dalio, one of our contacts and an invited guest, has agreed to offer his invitation to the bureau in exchange for a few minor favors. You will take his place, undercover. Peter has attested that no one on the invitation list has met him in person.</p><p>Background on Peter </p><p>Peter Dalio, age 47, is a hedge fund manager at Romney Capital. He is intensely curious in nature, and has an insatiable appetite to ask questions, a quirk which has allowed him to advance his career. Peter generally values wealth, and hopes to accrue it if given a reasonable opportunity to do so. Peter's invitation to the gala stems from his affiliation with the Agatha Fellowship. In particular, Dalio was an Agatha Fellow ('94) where he established a strong network of peers.</p><p>Peter has let us know that he has been in correspondence with Elizabeth Balwani and Nora Harris about their upcoming board elections for Agatha Pharmaceuticals. Peter will vote in this election, as the hedge fund of which he is an employee is a large shareholder. Peter has also been in contact with Gabriel Weber, and needs to make a decision soon regarding whether or not to allocate hedge fund investments toward his new company. For now, it may be best to keep these conversations secret.</p><p>While not a priority, in order to remain in Peter's good graces, we should strive to support his personal objectives as well. </p><p>You should see a separate tab open on your device with background on the Agatha Pharmaceuticals Board Election. Refer to this to orient yourself to your identity for the evening.</p><br><br><p>George Lestrade </p><p>SBI Bureau Chief </p>";

She argues that the company should aggressively transition to its new line of biomechanical engineering products, and that she will help the company find partnerships with major medical groups</p><p>3.

Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. </p><p>It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p><p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</p><p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of(The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, </p>";
